# Mobile
As part of our application process, we'd like to see what you can produce by giving you a take home assessment.

# Test Specification
You are required to create a flutter package based off this design as seen on this Figma board (https://www.figma.com/file/byfb8g5JpIEfZn7PyV0jTY/Mobile-Engineer-Demo?node-id=0%3A1).

# Expectations
You are expected to use your Intuition and creativity to fill in the missing blanks. We will be testing for Skill, Intuition and Creativity

Please take note of the following points:

- Only use Flutter to get it done
- You have just 2 days to complete the test.
- UI Frameworks like VelocityX won't be accepted
- A Mobile Responsive design will be an added advantage
- Also make sure that your project is on github and accessible to us
- Ensure to create an example app that uses the package you created

You'll be assessed based on but not limited to the following:

- Your ability to create a reusable flutter package
- Design implementation
- Coding pattern
- Proper Component decomposition and reuse
- Correctness of dart syntax. Effective dart is important to us.
- Demonstration of knowledge of the chosen framework (flutter)
- Tests

# Bonus points
- Setting up github actions to run tests, coverage report and build example app
- Add coverage report badge to tell %coverage

# How do I submit?
* Create a github repository, implement your solution and send us the link.
* Create a ReadMe file with `firstname-lastname.md` (where firstname and lastname are your 
  first and last name respectively) where you add relevant information on how to setup/run/test your submission
